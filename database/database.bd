{"title":"HOW POWERFUL ARE GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS?","author":null,"abstract":"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and trans- forming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler- Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.","publisher":null,"url":null,"path":"/Users/wubolun/Bowen/SJTU/Netsec&TS Lab/papers/gnn/ICLR_GIN.pdf","tags":["MCBG","AI","GNN"],"remark":"GIN<br>","_id":"FhXbP9BUmctbFgQR"}
{"title":"UNICORN: Runtime Provenance-Based Detector for Advanced Persistent Threats<br>","author":null,"abstract":"Abstract—Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are difficult to detect due to their “low-and-slow” attack patterns and frequent use of zero-day exploits. We present UNICORN, an anomaly- based APT detector that effectively leverages data provenance analysis. From modeling to detection, UNICORN tailors its design specifically for the unique characteristics of APTs. Through extensive yet time-efficient graph analysis, UNICORN explores provenance graphs that provide rich contextual and historical information to identify stealthy anomalous activities without pre- defined attack signatures. Using a graph sketching technique, it summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency to combat slow-acting attacks that take place over a long time span. UNICORN further improves its detection capability using a novel modeling approach to understand long-term behavior as the system evolves. Our evaluation shows that UNICORN outperforms an existing state-of-the-art APT detection system and detects real- life APT scenarios with high accuracy.","publisher":"NDSS 2020","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01525","path":"/Users/wubolun/Bowen/SJTU/Netsec&TS Lab/papers/apt/UNICORN Runtime Provenance-Based Detector for Advanced Persistent Threats.pdf","tags":["APT-Detection","APT"],"remark":"基于异常的检测","_id":"iRwZTALCZZMbvFQu"}
